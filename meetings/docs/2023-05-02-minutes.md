- [Digital Engineering discussion board](https://github.com/niemopen/ntac-admin/discussions/41)
- Blocked by a whole lot of work on CMFTool, or until comments come in

## CMFTool

- New version in `dev` branch
  - https://github.com/niemopen/cmftool
  - The core model is translated from XSD to CMF and back, apparently without loss.
  - Does the whole 5.2 model without crashing, produces 40 megs of CMF in 120 seconds.
  - Handles external definitions in CMF, but when generating XSD from CMF, providing the external XSD is a manual step; CMFTool doesn't do it.
  - [ ] CMFTool could use static files for the externals in the NIEM distro, just as it now does for niem-xs.xsd and utility schemas.

## New Business

- Duncan Sparrell:
	- NIEM 5.2 as an OASIS release
	- #resolved Recommend PGB approve it as a release; proposed action for the July PGB.

- Scott Renner:
	- New NDR rule that says you can't have `<xs:element type="structures:…`?
	- [ ] Dr. Scott to post as an NDR issue

* Christina Medlin:
   - Role properties [](Issue #6)](https://github.com/niemopen/niem-naming-design-rules/issues/6) is the most important NDR issue outstanding
    			- Need to nail this down
         		- Currently clunky implementation
         		- Harder for new folks, or folks who aren't doing anything fancy
         		- `structures:uri` attribute might let us do it in a simpler way
         			- allowing linking for those who needs it
         			- others would just extend `PersonType`
         		- [ ] Dr. Scott to work up a bigger example
         		- Potential issues
         			- `structures:uri` can point to external resources
         			- No XML Schema validation
         			- How does the RDF look with multiple roles?
